# Introduction

This repository is designed as example of creating a new task for use in workshops.
It is based on the [`task_template` repository](https://github.com/openproblems-bio/task_template) but some components/files have been removed/edited so that they can re-created during the workshop.
**NOTE:** This means that the task is incomplete and some normal commands will fail until the steps below have been created.

## Proof of concept

The `proof-of-concept.py` script contains a minimal label projection task.
This is the base that we we want to turn into proper components connected by a workflow.

## Update the task `_viash.yaml` config file

- Briefly explain and fill in the sections of the file
- Skip the test resources as this has already be configured to be the minimum needed for the example
