# Introduction

This repository is designed as example of creating a new task for use in workshops.
It is based on the [`task_template` repository](https://github.com/openproblems-bio/task_template) but some components/files have been removed/edited so that they can re-created during the workshop.
**NOTE:** This means that the task is incomplete and some normal commands will fail until the steps below have been created.
